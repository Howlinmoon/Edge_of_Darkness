The Edge of Darkness MUD from 1996? 

No idea what condition the code is in. This compiled on an Ultra 5 back in 1998.

./dms should launch the game - in the proper environment

I make no claims to this source code, I am merely archiving it here.

I have had this backup of the codebase for almost 30 years now. I am posting it so it is not lost to time, but will remove it from github if an original author from the Colorado University where this was originally hosted requests it.
