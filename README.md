The Edge of Darkness MUD from 1996? 

No idea what condition the code is in. This compiled on an Ultra 5 back in 1998.

./dms should launch the game - in the proper environment

I make no claims to this source code, I am merely archiving it here.

I have had this backup of the codebase for almost 30 years now. I am posting it so it is not lost to time, but will remove it from github if an original author from the Colorado University where this was originally hosted requests it.

What *IS* the Edge of Darkness?  Well, that question should probably more accurately be "What *WAS* the Edge of Darkness?"

There are some old web pages still hanging around describing the MUD - such as this one:

Sadly, the official website seems to be offline.  (As well as the MUD - so maybe not a surprise)
